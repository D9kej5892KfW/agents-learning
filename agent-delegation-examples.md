# Agent Delegation Examples & Results

## Overview
This document demonstrates successful agent delegation using the Task tool with various specializations.

## Delegation Patterns Tested

### 1. Sequential Delegation
- **Security Analysis Agent**: Focused on vulnerability assessment
- **Architecture Analysis Agent**: Systems design and patterns evaluation

### 2. Parallel Delegation  
- **Code Quality Agent**: Quality assessment and best practices
- **Performance Analysis Agent**: Bottleneck identification and optimization

## Key Findings

### Agent Specialization Works
Each delegated task produced specialized analysis:
- Security agent focused on credentials, PCI compliance, vulnerability scoring
- Architecture agent emphasized SOLID principles, design patterns, scalability
- Quality agent covered naming, error handling, documentation
- Performance agent highlighted algorithmic complexity, memory usage

### Parallel Processing Successful
- Multiple agents can work simultaneously on the same codebase
- Each provides complementary insights without overlap
- Results delivered efficiently with specialized focus

### Task Tool Effectiveness
- Successfully delegates complex analysis tasks
- Maintains context and provides detailed, actionable feedback
- Produces professional-grade analysis comparable to senior developers

## Agent Capabilities Observed

### Security Agent
- ✅ Vulnerability identification with CVSS scoring
- ✅ Compliance assessment (PCI DSS, OWASP)
- ✅ Remediation priorities and recommendations
- ✅ Code-specific line number references

### Architecture Agent  
- ✅ Design pattern analysis and recommendations
- ✅ SOLID principle evaluation
- ✅ Scalability assessment with metrics
- ✅ Migration strategy development

### Quality Agent
- ✅ Code convention analysis
- ✅ Error handling assessment  
- ✅ Documentation gap identification
- ✅ Best practice recommendations

### Performance Agent
- ✅ Algorithmic complexity analysis (Big O notation)
- ✅ Memory usage optimization
- ✅ Bottleneck identification
- ✅ Performance improvement quantification

## Task Delegation Syntax Learned

```javascript
// Basic delegation
Task({
    description: "Brief task description",
    prompt: "Detailed instructions with specific focus",
    subagent_type: "general-purpose"
})

// Parallel delegation
Task({ /* Agent 1 */ })
Task({ /* Agent 2 */ })  // Runs simultaneously
```

## Next Steps
- Test wave orchestration for complex multi-stage operations
- Create custom agent configurations 
- Explore SuperClaude delegation flags (--delegate, --concurrency)
- Measure performance improvements from parallel processing
