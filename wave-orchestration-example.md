# Wave Orchestration Example & Results

## Overview
Demonstrated multi-wave agent coordination for comprehensive enterprise system analysis. Three specialized agents worked in coordinated waves, each building upon previous wave findings.

## Wave Structure Executed

### Wave 1: Architecture Review
- **Focus**: System architecture, service boundaries, design patterns
- **Agent Role**: Architect persona with systems thinking
- **Output**: Foundational architectural assessment and scoring
- **Key Findings**: Layered monolith with clear domains but some anti-patterns

### Wave 2: Security Analysis  
- **Focus**: Vulnerability assessment, authentication flaws, compliance
- **Agent Role**: Security persona with threat modeling
- **Dependencies**: Built upon architectural findings from Wave 1
- **Key Findings**: 8 critical vulnerabilities requiring immediate action

### Wave 3: Performance Review
- **Focus**: Database patterns, caching, algorithmic complexity
- **Agent Role**: Performance persona with optimization focus  
- **Dependencies**: Considered architectural and security constraints from previous waves
- **Key Findings**: Critical O(nÂ²) bottlenecks and database optimization needs

## Wave Coordination Benefits Observed

### 1. Progressive Enhancement
- Each wave built upon previous findings
- Security analysis considered architectural boundaries
- Performance review respected security constraints
- Holistic view emerged from coordinated analysis

### 2. Specialized Expertise
- Architecture agent focused on patterns and scalability
- Security agent provided CVSS scoring and compliance analysis
- Performance agent delivered algorithmic complexity analysis
- No overlap or contradiction between agent recommendations

### 3. Integrated Recommendations
- Final recommendations considered all three domains
- Prioritization reflected combined architectural, security, and performance impact
- Implementation plan addressed cross-cutting concerns
- Quality scores reflected multi-dimensional assessment

## Key Learnings

### Wave Orchestration Triggers
- High complexity system (multiple files, domains)
- Multi-domain analysis requirements (security + performance + architecture)
- Enterprise-level scope requiring systematic coordination
- Need for progressive, building analysis

### Agent Coordination Patterns
- Sequential waves with knowledge transfer between phases
- Specialized focus per wave with clear boundaries
- Cumulative analysis building comprehensive picture
- Integration of findings across domains

### Task Tool for Wave Management
- Successfully coordinated 3 parallel Task tool invocations
- Each agent maintained specialized focus
- Results integrated naturally through wave progression
- No conflicts or redundancy observed

## Wave vs Single Analysis Comparison

### Single Analysis Approach
- Broad surface-level coverage
- Risk of missing domain-specific details
- Limited depth in specialized areas
- Potential for conflicting recommendations

### Wave Orchestration Approach
- Deep domain expertise per wave
- Coordinated, building analysis
- Comprehensive, integrated view
- Prioritized, actionable recommendations

## Next Steps for Wave Development
- Test wave delegation flags (--wave-mode, --wave-strategy)
- Explore adaptive wave strategies based on complexity
- Implement wave validation and quality gates
- Create custom wave patterns for specific project types
